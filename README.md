# Website-Redesign
Redesigned the website of "Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Greece)", for the course of Human-Computer Interaction. Both front-end (HTML &amp; CSS) and back-end (PHP &amp; MySQL) technologies were used. In [README.pdf](README.pdf) you can see more information (in greek) about the procedure that was undertaken.

## How to run
1. To run locally a PHP program you need to have Xampp installed. 
2. After installation, start Mysql and Apache servers. 
3. Clone this repo under htdocs folder. For example, in linux systems, htdocs can be found in this location ```/opt/lampp/htdocs```.
4. Run ```localhost/Website-Redesign/ypakp/index.php``` in any browser. 

For more information see the following [steps](https://www.edureka.co/blog/how-to-run-a-php-program-in-xampp/), which explain the process of installation and running.
